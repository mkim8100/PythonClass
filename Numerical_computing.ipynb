    "- It is easy to understand.  It is not something to do with numbers only. (e.g.when you google numerical computing, they simply have to reference the majority ofthe time something to do with numbers.  But we are talking about something including numbers, something more than numbers, that we can actually use this against text or even images.  That is the point that we are trying to make here. \n",

    "- When you search in google, tylenol, and you get the results, and if your understanding is that google is actually searching  the keyword tylenol, that is actually a misconception.  So you may be wondering how is actually doing the results or returning the results?  That is the answer that we are looking at today. The basis for that response from google, as an example, is based on numerical computing.  We humans inherently use numbers for everything.  You may not actually know that.  If you understand neural concepts, you will understand we are actually using numerical numbers. \n",

    "A. computers are optimized to perform better when the data is converted into numerical format. So these algorithms, they don't actually look for texts.  If you are looking for texts, the processing takes a lot of time.  So they are looking for NUMERICAL REFERENCE. \n",

Under 29 occurrences, you can associate this word \"daddy\" with a numerical value.  Whether it is 29 or convert this into a completely different hashcode. It is totally up to you.  But at least now you actually have a numerical reference.  So what you just learned right now, 29 references is also an algorithm.  It is called TERM FREQUENCY: the number of times a word surfaces in a corpus or a text.  Simply put, it is also called a \"word count.\" \n",

If you have your ears open in the water, if someone rings a bell, you can exactly point out where the sound is coming from.  So submarines use this very critical accoustic measurements to transform the sound waves to the location.  Meaning it is not a direct transformation from sound waves to location.  They are going to look at the frequency, and they are converting the frequency to time series.  That is the purpose of the Fourier Transformation (Frequency to Time Series).  \n",

In air, what we actually do is we actually send out bad signals, we fly out planes to deter enemy planes from coming into our airspace.  We send fighters to intercept enemy aircraft.  The same concept is applied to underwater.  We don't actually have radar, they send shockwaves or sound waves.  Shockwaves can come in many forms, just by exploring a dummy torpedo.  That will actually send the position or the location on where the location of where the enemy submarine is.  That signal is usually transpired by Fourier Transformation. \n",
